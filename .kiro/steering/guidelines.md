# Task Guidelines

## Context
- I am a solo developer working on small hackathon project
- This is NOT an enterprise-level project
- I prefer simple, direct solutions over "best practices"
- I value shipping over perfect architecture

## What to do
- Always assume this is a POC (Proof of Concept) unless explicitly told otherwise
- Keep it simple and direct - don't overthink it
- Start with the most obvious solution that works
- No frameworks unless absolutely necessary

## What NOT to do
- Don't create any test files or markdown files unless explicitly specified
- Don't add abstractions until we actually need them
- Don't build for imaginary future requirements
- Don't add complex error handling for edge cases that probably won't happen
- Don't suggest design patterns unless the problem actually requires them
- Don't optimize prematurely
- Don't add configuration for things that rarely change
