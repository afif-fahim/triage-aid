# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds voice-to-text functionality with local AI model integration to TriageAid, enabling medical personnel to perform faster triage assessments through voice input. The system will transcribe speech to text, then use a local small language model to automatically populate triage assessment forms, while maintaining complete offline functionality and data privacy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to enable voice mode for triage assessments, so that I can quickly input patient information without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the triage assessment form THEN the system SHALL display a voice mode toggle option
2. WHEN the user enables voice mode THEN the system SHALL activate speech recognition capabilities
3. WHEN the user speaks into the microphone THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text in real-time
4. WHEN speech recognition is complete THEN the system SHALL display the transcribed text in an editable textarea
5. IF the user is offline THEN the voice recognition SHALL still function using local capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to download and use a local AI model for triage assessment, so that I can automatically populate assessment forms from voice transcriptions while maintaining data privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is online THEN the system SHALL provide an option to download the local AI model
2. WHEN the user chooses to download the AI model THEN the system SHALL download and store the model locally
3. WHEN the AI model is available locally THEN the system SHALL enable AI-assisted form population
4. WHEN the user provides voice input THEN the AI SHALL analyze the transcribed text and suggest values for triage assessment fields
5. WHEN AI suggestions are generated THEN the system SHALL populate the assessment form with suggested values
6. IF the user is offline AND the model is downloaded THEN the AI functionality SHALL work without internet connection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to review and modify AI-generated assessment values, so that I can ensure accuracy before saving the patient assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI populates the assessment form THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which fields were auto-populated
2. WHEN the user reviews the form THEN the system SHALL allow manual editing of all auto-populated fields
3. WHEN the user modifies any field THEN the system SHALL save the user's changes
4. WHEN the user is satisfied with the assessment THEN the system SHALL allow saving the complete assessment
5. WHEN the assessment is saved THEN the system SHALL store it using the existing secure local storage mechanism

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to correct transcription errors before AI processing, so that I can ensure accurate assessment generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN speech is transcribed to text THEN the system SHALL display the text in an editable textarea
2. WHEN the user identifies transcription errors THEN the system SHALL allow text editing before AI processing
3. WHEN the user finishes editing the transcription THEN the system SHALL provide a button to trigger AI analysis
4. WHEN AI analysis is triggered THEN the system SHALL process the corrected text to populate assessment fields
5. IF the transcription is accurate THEN the user SHALL be able to proceed directly to AI analysis without editing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage AI model downloads and storage, so that I can control when and how the AI functionality is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses voice AI settings THEN the system SHALL display current model status (downloaded/not downloaded)
2. WHEN the user is online AND no model is downloaded THEN the system SHALL provide a download option
3. WHEN the model is being downloaded THEN the system SHALL show download progress
4. WHEN the model download is complete THEN the system SHALL enable AI functionality
5. WHEN storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL warn the user about storage requirements before download

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be informed about language support limitations, so that I understand current and future capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses voice AI features THEN the system SHALL display that English is currently supported
2. WHEN the user views language options THEN the system SHALL show a notification that Arabic support is coming soon
3. WHEN the user enables voice mode THEN the system SHALL indicate the current language setting
4. WHEN the user attempts to use unsupported languages THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback
5. IF the user's system language is Arabic THEN the system SHALL display the "coming soon" message in Arabic

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want the voice AI feature to integrate seamlessly with existing triage workflows, so that I can use it without disrupting established processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice AI is disabled THEN the system SHALL function exactly as before with no impact on existing workflows
2. WHEN voice AI is enabled THEN the system SHALL enhance but not replace existing manual input methods
3. WHEN using voice AI THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing data validation and security measures
4. WHEN assessments are saved THEN the system SHALL store them in the same format regardless of input method
5. WHEN viewing saved assessments THEN the system SHALL not distinguish between voice-generated and manually-entered data
