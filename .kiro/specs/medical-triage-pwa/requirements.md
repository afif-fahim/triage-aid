# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help medical teams quickly assess and prioritize patients in clinics or shelters using offline, low-power tools. The application aims to reduce manual intake time and improve urgent care flow by providing a simple, secure, and efficient triage system that works without internet connectivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a medical professional working in a clinic or shelter, I want to quickly assess patients using a simple digital form, so that I can reduce manual paperwork and speed up the intake process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a medical professional opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a patient intake form with essential triage fields
2. WHEN entering patient data THEN the system SHALL only collect critical triage-relevant information (pulse, breathing status, circulation/bleeding, mental status/consciousness, major injuries)
3. WHEN creating a new patient record THEN the system SHALL auto-generate a unique anonymous patient ID without collecting PII
4. WHEN selecting age group THEN the system SHALL provide options for child and adult categories
5. WHEN all required fields are completed THEN the system SHALL enable form submission

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want the app to automatically determine patient priority levels using established triage protocols, so that I can quickly identify who needs immediate attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN patient vital signs are entered THEN the system SHALL apply START Triage algorithm logic
2. WHEN triage assessment is complete THEN the system SHALL assign one of four priority levels: Red (Immediate), Yellow (Delayed), Green (Minor), or Black (Deceased)
3. WHEN priority is assigned THEN the system SHALL display the result with clear color coding and description
4. WHEN triage logic determines Red priority THEN the system SHALL indicate life-threatening status requiring immediate intervention
5. WHEN triage logic determines Yellow priority THEN the system SHALL indicate serious injuries requiring care within hours
6. WHEN triage logic determines Green priority THEN the system SHALL indicate minor injuries that can wait
7. WHEN triage logic determines Black priority THEN the system SHALL indicate deceased or non-survivable injuries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to view all triaged patients in a dashboard, so that I can quickly see patient priorities and manage workflow efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the patient dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a list of all triaged patients
2. WHEN viewing patient entries THEN the system SHALL show patient ID, priority level with color coding, and brief status summary
3. WHEN clicking on a patient entry THEN the system SHALL open detailed patient information for viewing or editing (an edit button will enable editing)
4. WHEN patients are listed THEN the system SHALL sort them by priority level (Red first, then Yellow, Green, Black)
5. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for quick priority scanning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a medical professional working in areas with unreliable internet, I want the app to work completely offline, so that I can continue patient assessment without connectivity concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is accessed without internet connection THEN the system SHALL function fully offline
2. WHEN data is entered offline THEN the system SHALL store all information locally using IndexedDB
3. WHEN the app is restarted THEN the system SHALL persist all previously entered patient data
4. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL not require any network requests for core functionality
5. WHEN the device goes offline during use THEN the system SHALL continue operating without interruption

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a medical professional handling sensitive patient information, I want patient data to be secure and anonymous, so that I can protect patient privacy while maintaining operational efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN patient data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data using client-side encryption
2. WHEN creating patient records THEN the system SHALL not collect or store any personally identifiable information
3. WHEN generating patient IDs THEN the system SHALL create anonymous, unique identifiers (but easy to use for the medical professional in the field to identify patients)
4. WHEN data is stored locally THEN the system SHALL use encrypted storage mechanisms
5. WHEN accessing stored data THEN the system SHALL decrypt data only when needed for display

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to update patient information as conditions change, so that I can maintain accurate triage status throughout treatment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a patient's details THEN the system SHALL provide options to edit triage information
2. WHEN patient condition changes THEN the system SHALL allow updating of vital signs and priority level
3. WHEN treatment is provided THEN the system SHALL allow marking patients as "treated" or "transferred"
4. WHEN updates are made THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate triage priority if vital signs change
5. WHEN status changes are saved THEN the system SHALL update the patient dashboard immediately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a medical professional working in diverse environments, I want the app interface in multiple languages, so that I can use it effectively regardless of the local language requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the app THEN the system SHALL support English and Arabic language options
2. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL translate all UI elements including forms, buttons, and labels
3. WHEN language is selected THEN the system SHALL persist the language preference across app sessions
4. WHEN displaying triage results THEN the system SHALL show priority levels and descriptions in the selected language
5. WHEN using non-English languages THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality without degradation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a medical professional using older or low-power devices, I want the app to run efficiently on limited hardware, so that I can use available equipment without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on low-power devices THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
2. WHEN using older smartphones THEN the system SHALL function without requiring high-end hardware specifications
3. WHEN the app is loaded THEN the system SHALL minimize battery consumption during operation
4. WHEN processing triage calculations THEN the system SHALL complete assessments quickly without device lag
5. WHEN storing data locally THEN the system SHALL optimize storage usage for devices with limited capacity
